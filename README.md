# OO Robot

![tug robot](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/web-dev-readme-photos/oo-labs/tug.jpg)

## Background

According to a Wired [article](http://www.wired.com/2015/02/incredible-hospital-robot-saving-lives-also-hate/), the hospital at the University of California Mission Bay has started to use robots to help clean linens, deliver drugs, serve meals, and dispose of waste. 

These robots, known as Tugs, are only four feet tall and travel an average of twelve miles a day while performing their tasks. They avoid bumping into other medical workers and walls with the help of a lazer and twenty-seven infrared and ultrasonic sensors.

Tugs are tapped into the hospital's Wi-Fi which allows for some pretty cool behavours. For instance, when they're alerted that there's a fire via the network, they get out of the way to allow us mortals to escape the building. They can also "hail" an elevator through the internet.

## Objective

Build a robot class that mimics the Tug behaviour.

## Instructions

All your code will go in `lib/robot.rb`. Run your testing suite to get started.
